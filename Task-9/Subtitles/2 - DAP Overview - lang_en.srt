1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
So what is this data analysis process?

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,595
We broke it up into five steps: question,

3
00:00:05,594 --> 00:00:09,695
wrangle, explore, draw conclusions and communicate.

4
00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:11,790
This process will help you understand,

5
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:13,379
explore and use your data

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,250
intelligently so that you make the most of the information you're given.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,199
Whether you're building your reporting dashboard,

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,519
analyzing A-B test results or doing more advanced analysis with machine learning and AI.

9
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,774
Let's see what each step is about.

10
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:31,184
The data analysis process always starts with asking questions.

11
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:33,539
Sometimes, you're already given a data set and

12
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,890
glance over it to figure out good questions to ask.

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,105
Other times, your questions come first,

14
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:42,644
which will determine what kinds of data you'll gather later.

15
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:46,790
In both cases, you should be thinking: what am I trying to find out?

16
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:49,289
Is there a problem I'm trying to solve?

17
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,984
For example, what are the characteristics of students who pass their projects?

18
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:57,420
How can I better stock my store with products people want to buy?

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,890
In the real world, you often deal with multiple sets of massive amounts of data,

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,884
all in different forms.

21
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:06,929
The right questions can really help you focus on relevant parts of

22
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,060
your data and direct your analysis towards meaningful insights.

23
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,549
In this course, we're going to focus on use cases with one set of

24
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,140
data and practice posing

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,314
relevant and interesting questions that lead to valuable results.

26
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,879
Once you have your questions,

27
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,859
you'll need to wrangle your data to help you answer them.

28
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:31,230
By that, I mean making sure you have all the data you need in great quality.

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,310
There are three parts to this step.

30
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,359
First, you gather your data.

31
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,269
If you are already given that data,

32
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:38,964
then all you need to do is open it,

33
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,725
like importing it into a Jupyter Notebook.

34
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:43,134
If you weren't provided data,

35
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:46,480
you need think carefully about what data would be most helpful in

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,189
answering your questions and then collect them from all the sources available.

37
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:53,620
Second, you assess your data to identify

38
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,245
any problems in your data's quality or structure.

39
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:59,375
Third, you clean your data.

40
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,840
This often involves modifying, replacing,

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,320
or moving data to ensure that your data set

42
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,939
is as high quality and well-structured as possible.

43
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:09,699
This wrangling step is all about getting

44
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,549
the data you need in a form that you can work with.

45
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,225
Sometimes, this step will be really easy and straightforward.

46
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,474
Other times, it's a little more tricky.

47
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:20,465
Now that you've wrangle your data,

48
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:22,860
you'll hopefully have good quality, clean data.

49
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,485
Which means, you're ready to explore.

50
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:31,960
EDA or exploratory data analysis is about exploring and then augmenting

51
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,270
your data to maximize the potential of your analyses, visualizations, and models.

52
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,745
Exploring involves finding patterns in your data,

53
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:41,844
visualizing relationships in your data

54
00:02:41,844 --> 00:02:44,949
and just building intuition about what you're working with.

55
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:47,875
After exploring, you can do things like remove outliers

56
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,384
and create new and more descriptive features from existing data,

57
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,634
also known as feature engineering.

58
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:57,399
Many times modifying and engineer your data properly and

59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,745
even creatively can significantly increase the quality of your analysis.

60
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:04,867
As you become more familiar with your data in this EDA step,

61
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:07,209
you'll often revisit previous steps.

62
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,400
For example, you might discover new problems in your data and go back to wrangle them.

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,330
Or you might discover exciting,

64
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,620
unexpected patterns and decide to refine your questions.

65
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,314
The data analysis process isn't always linear.

66
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:23,740
This exploratory step in particular is very intertwined with the rest of the process.

67
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,825
It's usually where you discover and learn the most about your data.

68
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:31,364
After you've done your exploratory data analysis,

69
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:35,635
you want to draw conclusions or even make predictions.

70
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,729
For example, predicting which students will

71
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:40,474
fail a project so you can reach out to those students.

72
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:43,039
Or predicting which products are most likely

73
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,949
to sell so you can start your store appropriately.

74
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:48,004
From a data science perspective,

75
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:50,960
this step is typically approached with machine learning or

76
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,960
inferential statistics that are beyond the scope of this course.

77
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,540
But there are additional courses on Udacity

78
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:59,870
they can take on these topics, if you're interested.

79
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,865
Those are linked in instructor resources below.

80
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:06,230
This course will help you form a solid foundation on drawing

81
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:10,729
conclusions from summarizing data with descriptive statistics.

82
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:14,149
Finally, you need to communicate your results to others.

83
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,194
This is one of the most important skills you can develop.

84
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:21,784
Your analysis is only as valuable as your ability to communicate it.

85
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:25,975
You often need to justify and convey meaning in the insights you found.

86
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:28,265
Or if your end goal is to build a system,

87
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:31,199
like a movie recommender or a news feed ranking algorithm,

88
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,610
you usually to share what you've built,

89
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,420
explain how you reach design decisions and report how well it performs.

90
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,785
You can communicate results in many ways.

91
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:43,460
Reports, slide decks, blog posts,

92
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:46,864
emails, presentations, or even conversations.

93
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:49,569
Regardless of your method of communication,

94
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:53,730
data visualization will always be very valuable.

95
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,160
So those are the five steps of the data analysis process: question,

96
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,745
wrangle, explore, draw conclusions and communicate.

97
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:06,379
Before jumping into how you go through this process on a real data set in Python,

98
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:10,000
we are going to work on building intuition for each step.
