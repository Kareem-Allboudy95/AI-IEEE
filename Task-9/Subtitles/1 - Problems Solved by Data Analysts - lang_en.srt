00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,279
Before we jump into the data analysis process,

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,139
let's talk about some of the kinds of problems you might solve as a data analyst.

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,744
When many people hear the term data analyst,

4
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:14,070
they picture someone who works at a tech company and probably in Silicon Valley.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,765
Many data analysts do in fact work at tech companies.

6
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:20,550
For example, Netflix uses data analysis to

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,600
provide personalized movie recommendations for its users.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,820
Facebook uses it in its news feed ranking algorithm.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:35,179
And OkCupid uses it to predict which people are likely to be good romantic matches.

10
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,920
In addition to building these kinds of systems,

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,740
many companies also use data analysis to

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,300
publish papers or write blog posts about their findings.

13
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:50,234
For example, Facebook has studied the ideological diversity of people's political posts.

14
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:51,899
They found that when posts appear on

15
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,464
people's news feed written from a different perspective,

16
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:57,590
users are less likely to click on those posts.

17
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,805
OkCupid wrote a blog post about

18
00:00:59,804 --> 00:01:03,570
what are the best questions to ask someone on a first date.

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,909
Did you know that long term couples are very likely

20
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,700
to agree about whether they like horror movies?

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,305
Data analysts don't just work at tech companies though.

22
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,220
Wal-Mart looks through their purchase records and people's posts on

23
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,980
social media in order to figure out what to stock in their stores.

24
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,890
Apparently, Strawberry Pop-Tarts are more likely to sell right before a hurricane.

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,840
Bill James is famous for applying data analysis to baseball.

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,980
He used it to understand who the top performers

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,234
are and how to best predict future performance.

28
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:35,909
And pharmaceutical companies have started to use machine learning to

29
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,170
predict which chemical compounds are most likely to make effective drugs.

30
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,320
Using this, they can make better decisions about which compounds are

31
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,904
likely to be a good use of the resources involved in running a clinical trial.

32
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:50,400
If you'd like to learn more about any of these applications,

00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,130
